<h1 id="repl---read-evaluate-print-loop.">REPL - Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop.</h1>
<p>A REPL is a loop (the L part) that + Reads input and parses it into an R command(s) + Evaluates the command(s) + Prints the result and starts over again.</p>
<p>Why do we care? Partially because it helps to understand the nature of an error which might be a syntax error (at parse time) or run/evaluation-time semantic errors (e.g. no such variable, wrong input to a function).</p>
<p>We start an interpreter (R, python, MATLAB, etc.) and it gives us a prompt, waiting for our command. It is awaiting and reading our input. When we enter a character, it processes it potentially doing something such as suggesting auto-completion. The R part in the REPL comes in when we hit the <strong>return</strong> key. The REPL attempts to <strong>parse</strong> the text. There are three possibilities: 1) the line makes complete sense as a command, 2) contains a syntax error, or 3) forms an incomplete command that makes partial sense and that needs to be completed.</p>
<p>There are two steps in an R command - checking it is syntactically correct, and then if it makes sense - evaluating it.</p>
<p>R <strong>parses</strong> the text of the command to see if it is syntactically correct. If it is not, we get a syntax error. There are so many ways to write a command that is not syntactically correct. For example,</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">lapply</span>(x mean)
2pi =<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">1</span>
x[[<span class="dv">2</span>][<span class="dv">1</span>]
<span class="kw">lapply</span>(x mean <span class="dt">na.rm =</span> <span class="ot">TRUE</span>)</code></pre>
<p>If the command is syntatically complete and legitimate, i.e., makes sense syntactically, R tries to evaluate the <strong>expression</strong>. The rules for evaluation are somewhat involved, but basically we find variables along the <a href="SearchPath.html">search path</a>, and we make function calls. That's pretty much all there is to the R language.</p>
<p>It may seem that there is a lot more to the language, e.g. math operators, logic operators, sequence operator (a:b), subsetting ([, [[, $), assignments, for and while loops, if statements. But in fact, these are all function calls. That is one of the elegant aspects of the R language. Master function calls and you master the language. However, function calls are rich.</p>
